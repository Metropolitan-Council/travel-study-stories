# What is the Travel Behavior Inventory?

The Travel Behavior Inventory is a 10-year program that includes:

-   A household travel survey  
-   A once-in-five-years survey of on-board transit riders  
-   Other travel behavior data collection

## Household travel survey

The current wave of the household survey began deploying the week of
June 14, 2021. This wave of the survey was delayed due to COVID-19,
although in the interim, the team did conduct COVID-19 surveys to help
explain how the pandemic has changed and is changing regional travel.

The 2018-2019 household travel survey engaged more than 7,500 households
across the region to understand how they travel around the Twin Cities
and surrounding areas. The study ran from October 2018 through September
2019.

Participant households are randomly selected from 19 counties throughout
the greater Twin Cities region, including the seven-county metro area
and three Wisconsin counties.

The Met Council transitioned the household survey to collecting data
every other year instead of every 10 years, asking participants to use a
smartphone application for seven days, or choose a one-day travel survey
submitted online or over the phone.

These surveys are conducted in partnership with the Minnesota and
Wisconsin Departments of Transportation.

## What data are available?

Some variables are derived from raw survey responses.
